        <h4><b>Immigration policies, COVID-19 dry up international enrollment in U.S. colleges
        </b></4>
        <h6> 
           </h6>
        <h6><b>By Aadit Tambe</b></h6>
        <p>Dec. 7, 2020</p>
        
        <p>Artur Perevalov is an international student from Russia, who came to the U.S. to complete a graduate program in physics. Moving to the U.S. was his dream &mdash; a degree from a respected university, he said, coupled with STEM-related extracurricular opportunities, would give his career a kickstart.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I have more open doors to networking and defending my thesis here &mdash; this is better for my profession,&rdquo; he said.</p>
        
        <p>Perevalov&rsquo;s desire to seek an American education is shared by over a million foreign students: The U.S. has historically been a go-to destination for international students, who account for approximately 5.5 percent of the total student body.</p>
        
        <p>In recent years, however, foreign students from many countries are finding increasing barriers to entering the U.S. on student visas due to policies enacted by the Trump Administration &mdash; from amendments to visa application processes to travel restrictions &mdash;</p>
        
        <p>New international student enrollment, which was already on a three-year decline, has plummeted dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        
        <p>The University of Maryland&rsquo;s enrollment is reflective of this national trend and was on a slight decline before the COVID-19 pandemic began. The total number of new <a href="https://irpa.umd.edu/CampusCounts/Fall2019/Enrollments/stuprofile_newfresh.pdf">undegraduate</a>
          and <a href="https://irpa.umd.edu/CampusCounts/Fall2019/Enrollments/stuprofile_newgrad.pdf">graduate</a> students declined from 1,522 in the fall of 2017 to 1,256 in the fall of 2019.</p>
        
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4584693"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>While researchers point to immigration-related anxieties and fears as a primary reason for this drop, academics also cite the availability of educational opportunities in other countries, such as Australia and Germany, that may be cheaper for students.</p>
        
        <p>The diminished numbers of international students are a significant loss to the campus community, said Susan-Ellis Dougherty, director of International Student and Scholar Services in an email.  &ldquo;The interaction (between) domestic and international students can lead to a transformative educational experience,&rdquo; Dougherty said. &ldquo;Being exposed to a different culture is personally enriching, sensitizing and develops skills that are needed in today's global workplace.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Declining enrollment, she added, also poses economic challenges. International students at the University of Maryland are billed approximately $36,000 annually, the equivalent of out-state tuition, while in-state students are billed approximately $10,000.</p>
        
        <p>An analysis by <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/policy-and-advocacy/policy-resources/nafsa-international-student-economic-value-tool-v2">NAFSA</a>, a nonprofit association reporting on international education and exchange, found that foreign students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $38.7 billion to the local economy and supported approximately 415,996 jobs.</p>
        
        <p>There are 20,362 foreign students enrolled at colleges in the state of <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/policy-and-advocacy/policy-resources/nafsa-international-student-economic-value-tool-v2">Maryland</a>
          , contributing $761.4 million to the economy, while supporting 8,725 jobs.</p>

        <p>Sarina Maini &rsquo;22, a biology major who represents international student interests in the Student Government Association, said although the government has rescinded most of the actions it took to curb legal immigration, the effects are still felt among her constituents.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been extremely rough on international students (especially) with immigration-related policies,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;International students diversify (college campuses) &mdash; especially in terms of lived experiences they bring &mdash; it&rsquo;s extremely valuable to the university.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Maini said her constituents have expressed anxiety about securing post-graduation employment in the U.S. Finding employers willing to sponsor international students&rsquo; work permits was already difficult &mdash; the pandemic&rsquo;s economic implications have made it worse.</p>
        
        <p>Naren Manjunath, an international graduate student from India studying physics, said there has been a sense that the current administration&rsquo;s shaping of immigration policy is unpredictable. Although these changes haven&rsquo;t impacted him directly, Manjunath said he has experienced anxiety over travel bans and ICE orders.</p>
        
        <p>Tensions surrounding unpredictable changes in regulations have ramped up in the international student community. Referencing how quickly immigration laws can change, he said &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I have held my identity as an international student, very keenly.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Other international students have dealt with first-hand change caused by uncertain immigration laws. Every year Perevalov visits home, he is forced to apply for a new student visa to return to the University of Maryland. The visa, however, can take weeks or months to process &mdash; or worse, it can get rejected.</p>
        
        <p>The fifth-year graduate student is a Russian citizen, which means he can only be issued a one-year visa, although he is pursuing a five-year program. This is unlike most other international students, who are issued visas corresponding to the duration of their academic course.</p>
        
        <p>Perevalov says he has felt the pinch as Russia&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with the U.S. have altered. Since he is pursuing a doctorate in a science-related field, his application undergoes extra steps of scrutiny.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I have applied for a U.S. visa four times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was rejected twice and twice I actually got the visa. Both of those times, it took about four to five weeks. And it seems that I was lucky &mdash; many of my peers&#8230; who (applied to) renew their visas faced about&#8230; seven, eight or even nine months of waiting.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Increasing obstacles in the visa application processes translates to fewer foreign students applying to American universities&mdash;the effect of which is felt in a less diverse campus community.</p>
        
        <p>Georgina Dodge, vice president of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion echoed Dougherty in expressing the enrichment international students bring to U.S. colleges. While impacts of the changing immigration-policy landscape is unfortunate, she said, the result is predictable &mdash; as enrollment plummets, domestic students get fewer opportunities to interact with students who bring in diverse perspectives.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;The biggest thing that any student should derive out of a college education is a network &mdash; you&rsquo;re in college, you have an opportunity to be in classes, with other students from all over the world,&rdquo; she said.</p>
        
        <p>Universities need to do a better job of advocating on behalf of their foreign student population and lobby policymakers, she said. If more colleges unite, that understand the value of higher education, some of these problems can be mitigated.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I say this with a full understanding of the current administration that&rsquo;s in the White House,&rdquo; she said. The advocacy often falls on deaf ears &mdash; and that&rsquo;s unfortunate because I think that any administration should recognize the benefits of international intellectual exchange &mdash; and that&rsquo;s not the case with this current administration.&rdquo;</p>

        <h5><i>Newsgame: </i></h5>
          <p><i>The COVID-19 pandemic created a sense of anxiety among international students in the U.S. While some chose to return to their home countries, others stayed on campus. According to the New York Times, however, as their bank accounts dwindle, some had to turn to food banks for help. What would you do if you were in the U.S. trying to maintain an immigration status amid the COVID-19 pandemic?</i></p>
